h2. Writing Guides

Things to keep in mind:

* Use a text editor that supports word wrapping (like Textmate) to avoid having line breaks in paragraphs.
* We are using the same textile extensions that Rails Guides uses. See http://github.com/lifo/docrails/raw/master/railties/guides/source/ for examples of their documentation.
* From within browsercms, run +rake cms:guides+ to generate all the docs.
* To generate only one guide (like +writing_guides.textile+), run +rake cms:guides ONLY=writing_guides+
